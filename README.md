This is my current NixOS configuration, with my home-manager configuration from
[byronsharman/home-manager](https://github.com/byronsharman/home-manager) now
as a NixOS module in `home`. I'm still learning Nix and have yet to break
anything up into modules. I wouldn't recommend basing anything off of this
repository.
